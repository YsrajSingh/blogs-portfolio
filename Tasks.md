Hi buddy, I need you help in Three more tasks. Instead of updating the postlayout. update the each article file

1. Add a newsletter component in all artlces. (Somewhere between middle). dont update the psot layout and place this at end of file. this is not looking good.
2. The thumbmail images are not visible inside the article. LIke these must appear inside each article at top just like medium. (after the introductory paragraph)
3. the headings are coming twice.like at top and then when article starts (the same heading as sub heading)
