I'm Yashraj Singh, a Full Stack Developer with 5 years of experience building and optimizing scalable web applications. I specialize in Python, Django, FastAPI, React, and Next.js, and I’m passionate about crafting clean, efficient, and maintainable systems. My work focuses on backend architecture, AI-driven automation, and delivering seamless user experiences. I’ve deployed multiple cloud-native applications using AWS, Docker, and CI/CD pipelines, always aiming to streamline workflows and maximize performance.

Beyond development, I’m an active tech writer, having published 40+ articles on Medium with consistent monthly engagement from a growing audience. I enjoy breaking down complex topics into practical, real-world insights—especially around software development, automation, and innovation.

Some of my recent work includes an AI code assistant that speeds up web app development and a smart CRM powered by natural language prompts. I’m currently exploring machine learning integrations to further enhance productivity tools.

I thrive in product-focused environments, where problem-solving, ownership, and speed matter most. If you're looking for someone who thinks long-term, ships fast, and builds with purpose—I’d love to connect.
