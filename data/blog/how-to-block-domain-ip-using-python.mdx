Welcome to our step-by-step guide on domain blocking using a Python script. In this article, we'll explore the world of domain control without the need for third-party libraries. All you need is a basic understanding of Python and the root permissions for your system. Root permissions are essential for this process, and on Linux and macOS, you can use 'sudo,' while on Windows, administrative access to the terminal is required.

## The Python Script

In the following sections, we'll delve into the Python script responsible for blocking domains. This script is straightforward, efficient, and requires no external libraries. It enables you to control your internet experience by blocking specific domains or IP addresses.

```python
import platform

# Define the domain or IP address you want to block
target = "www.google.com"  # Change this to the domain or IP you want to block

# Determine the path to the host file based on the operating system
system = platform.system()
if system == "Windows":
    hosts_path = r"C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts"
else:
    hosts_path = "/etc/hosts"

# Open the host file in append mode and add an entry to block the target
with open(hosts_path, "a") as hosts_file:
    hosts_file.write(f"\n127.0.0.1    {target}\n")

print(f"Blocked {target} in the host file.")

# Note: On Linux and macOS, you may need to run this script with sudo for write access to /etc/hosts.
```

As seen in the code, we've humorously chosen [www.google.com](http://www.google.com/) as our target domain. We then access the hosts file and register this domain, effectively blocking it on our system.

## Customization

Customization is at your fingertips. If you wish to block a different IP or domain, simply modify the 'target' variable. This flexibility empowers you to tailor the script according to your specific needs.

## Verification

To verify whether the domain is successfully blocked, you have two options:

1. **Browser Verification:** Enter the domain in your browser's search bar and hit Enter. If the page doesn't load, your domain block is working.
2. **Terminal Ping Test:** Open your terminal and enter `ping www.google.com` (replace with your domain). If it shows the local IP address (127.0.0.1), your domain is effectively blocked. Any other IP address indicates that the block is not working.
