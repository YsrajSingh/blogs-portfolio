In this tutorial, we will explore how to integrate Okta Authentication into our React application. Our overarching goal is to implement Okta authentication in both our frontend (React) and backend (FastAPI). This tutorial will specifically focus on the React application.

Before proceeding, it's important to note that we have a prior tutorial that explains how to generate an Okta domain and Client ID, which we will be using in our React application. To begin, please review this tutorial: [Okta Authentication](https://ysraz.medium.com/enabling-okta-authentication-in-react-and-fastapi-58f629d88f9d) (Okta Setup)

## Installing Okta Dependencies

In your React application, you need to install two Okta dependencies: `@okta/okta-auth-js` and `@okta/okta-react`. You can install these using npm or yarn.

## Creating the Okta Configuration File

Next, create a file named `config.js` in the root folder of your React application. This file will hold your Okta Domain and Client ID configuration. Here's an example of what the `config.js` file should look like:

```typescript
const OKTA_ISSUER = 'https://<YOUR_OKTA_DOMAIN>/oauth2/default'
const OKTA_CLIENT_ID = '<YOUR_OKTA_CLIENT_ID>'
const OKTA_SCOPES = 'openid profile email'

const scopes = OKTA_SCOPES as string
const scopesArray = scopes && scopes.split(/\s+/)

export const oktaConfig = {
  issuer: OKTA_ISSUER as string,
  clientId: OKTA_CLIENT_ID as string,
  redirectUri: `${window.location.origin}/login/callback`,
  scopes: scopesArray || [],
  pkce: true,
  disableHttpsCheck: true,
}
```

## Securing Your Routes

Moving on to the next step, we will secure our routes. We will determine which routes require authentication and which ones are publicly accessible.

To secure your routes, make sure your react-router-dom version is 5 or lower. In this tutorial, we're using version 5.3.0. Update your route files as shown in the code snippet.

```typescript
import React, { Component } from "react";
import {
    Route,
    BrowserRouter,
    useHistory,
    Switch,
    withRouter,
} from "react-router-dom";
import { OktaAuth, toRelativeUrl } from "@okta/okta-auth-js";
import { Security, SecureRoute, LoginCallback } from "@okta/okta-react";
import { oktaConfig } from "../config";
import IndexPage from "../public/Index";
import SecretPage1 from "../private/SecretPage1";
import SecretPage2 from "../private/SecretPage2";

// Other Import statements here...

const oktaAuth = new OktaAuth(oktaConfig);

const Routes: React.FC = () => {
    const history = useHistory();

    const restoreOriginalUri = (_oktaAuth: OktaAuth, originalUri?: string) => {
        history.replace(
            toRelativeUrl(originalUri || "/", window.location.origin)
        );
    };

    return (
        <Security oktaAuth={oktaAuth} restoreOriginalUri={restoreOriginalUri}>
            <Switch>
                {/* Public routes */}
                <Route
                    path="/login/callback"
                    exact={true}
                    component={LoginCallback}
                />
                <Route exact path="/" component={IndexPage} />
                <SecureRoute exact path="/page1" component={SecretPage1} />
                <SecureRoute
                    exact
                    path="/page2"
                    component={SecretPage2}
                />
            </Switch>
        </Security>
    );
};

const AppWithRouterAccess = withRouter(Routes);

class AppRoutes extends Component {
    render() {
        return (
            <BrowserRouter>
                <AppWithRouterAccess />
            </BrowserRouter>
        );
    }
}

export default AppRoutes;
```

In the code above, you can see that the "index" and "login/callback" routes are public because we use the "Route" component from react-router-dom. Meanwhile, "SecretPage1" and "SecretPage2" are private routes as they use the "SecureRoute" component from "@okta/okta-react." Additionally, there is a wrapper for the "Security" component.

## Examining the Root File

Now, our main application file will resemble the following:

```typescript
import React from "react";
import AppRoutes from "./routes";

const App: React.FC = () => {
    return (
        <>
            <React.StrictMode>
                <AppRoutes />
            </React.StrictMode>
        </>
    );
};

export default App;
```

## About Sign-In and Sign-Out

Lastly, we need login and logout buttons to connect or redirect us to our landing or sign-in page. In my case, the header component will appear as follows:

```typescript
import { useOktaAuth } from "@okta/okta-react";

function Header() {
    const { oktaAuth, authState } = useOktaAuth();
    const logout = () => void oktaAuth.signOut();
    const login = () => void oktaAuth.signInWithRedirect({ originalUri: "/" });

    return (
        <>
            {authState?.isAuthenticated ? (
                <button
                    onClick={() => void logout()}
                    className="header-auth-btn logoutLogo"
                >
                    Log out
                </button>
            ) : (
                <button
                    onClick={() => void login()}
                    className="header-auth-btn logoutLogo"
                >
                    Log-In
                </button>
            )}
        </>
    );
}

export default Header;
```

## Bonus Section

As a bonus, to conditionally render components based on authentication, you can utilize the following code snippet:

```typescript
import { useOktaAuth } from '@okta/okta-react'
import useAuthUser from '../../hooks/getUser'

const { authState } = useOktaAuth()
const userInfo = useAuthUser()
```

The "authState" variable provides information about authentication, access tokens, and refresh tokens, while "userInfo" helps retrieve user details such as first name, last name, and email provided to the Okta app.

## Guidelines

We need to establish a section emphasizing the importance of matching the Okta domain, Okta Client ID, and redirect URI in the configuration file with the corresponding values in the Okta developer dashboard. On the other hand, we should also highlight the necessity of modifying the `/login/callback` route in the routes configuration.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've demonstrated how to integrate Okta Authentication into your React application using Vitejs. We covered the installation of Okta dependencies, the creation of the Okta configuration file, and securing your routes for authentication. You can also add login and logout buttons to enhance user interaction.

Additionally, we provided a bonus section on rendering conditional components based on authentication status and retrieving user information. With this knowledge, you can implement robust authentication and authorization features in your React application.
