![how to setup n8n with docker](https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/0*KoPtB6IjZCQggGg3.png)

<strong>n8n</strong> is an open-source workflow automation tool that helps automate repetitive
tasks, connect various services, and streamline your workflows. It can be easily set up using
<strong>Docker</strong>, allowing for fast deployment without the need to manually configure
environments. Docker is an excellent option because it encapsulates n8n and all of its dependencies
in a container, ensuring a consistent and reliable setup across different environments.

In this article, we'll walk you through the process of setting up <strong>n8n</strong> using <strong>Docker</strong>.

## Prerequisites

Before you get started, ensure that you have the following:

- <strong>Docker</strong> and <strong>Docker Compose</strong> installed on your system.
- Basic knowledge of how Docker works and familiarity with command-line operations.

If you don't have Docker installed, follow the installation guides for your operating system:

- [Install Docker on Linux](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)
- [Install Docker on macOS](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/mac-install/)
- [Install Docker on Windows](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/setup/install/windows-install/)

## Step 1: Pull the n8n Docker Image

n8n provides an official Docker image that we will use to set up the application. You can easily pull the image using the following command:

```bash
docker pull n8nio/n8n:latest
```

This will download the latest stable version of n8n from Docker Hub.

## Step 2: Set Up Docker Compose File

While you can run n8n with just a Docker command, <strong>Docker Compose</strong> is a better option to manage multiple services (like a database) and their interactions.

<strong>Create a new directory for your n8n setup:</strong>

```bash
mkdir n8n-docker
cd n8n-docker
```

<strong>
  Create a <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file in this directory:
</strong>

```yaml
services:
  n8n:
    image: n8nio/n8n:latest
    container_name: n8n
    restart: always
    env_file:
      - .env
    ports:
      - 5678:5678
    volumes:
      - n8n_data:/home/node/.n8n

volumes:
  n8n_data:
```

<strong>
  Create a <code>.env</code> file in the same directory:
</strong>

```env
DB_TYPE=postgresdb
DB_POSTGRESDB_HOST=n8n_postgres
DB_POSTGRESDB_PORT=5432
DB_POSTGRESDB_USER=n8n
DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD=${DB_POSTGRESDB_PASSWORD}
DB_POSTGRESDB_DATABASE=n8n

# Email Configuration (for SMTP)
N8N_EMAIL_MODE=smtp
N8N_SMTP_HOST=n8n.smtp.host
N8N_SMTP_PORT=587
N8N_SMTP_USER=${N8N_SMTP_USER}
N8N_SMTP_PASS=${N8N_SMTP_PASS}
N8N_SMTP_SENDER=${N8N_SMTP_SENDER_EMAIL}
N8N_SMTP_SSL=false
# N8N_SMTP_SSL=true # Set to false only if using STARTTLS

# Basic Authentication (for securing n8n)
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER=${N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER}
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD=${N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD}

# Timezone and Encryption Settings
GENERIC_TIMEZONE=Europe/Berlin
N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY=${N8N_ENCRYPTION_KEY}

N8N_TRUST_PROXY=true
N8N_PROXY_HOPS=1

# n8n Host and Port Settings
N8N_HOST=n8n.yourdomain.com
N8N_PORT=5678

# Webhook URL (ensure this is set to your production URL in a live environment)
WEBHOOK_URL=https://n8n.yourdomain.com/webhook
```

## Step 3: Start n8n with Docker Compose

In the same directory as your <code>docker-compose.yml</code>, run the following command to start the services:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Once the services are up and running, you can access n8n by navigating to [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678) in your browser.

## Step 4: Configure your nginx file

If you want to use a reverse proxy, here's a sample nginx configuration:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name n8n.yourdomain.com;
    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:5678;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Upgrade $http_upgrade;
        proxy_set_header Connection "upgrade";
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-For $proxy_add_x_forwarded_for;
        proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Proto https;
        proxy_read_timeout 3600;
        proxy_send_timeout 3600;
        proxy_buffering off;
        client_max_body_size 100M;
    }
}
```

## Step 5: Access n8n Web Interface

After running the above command, you can access the n8n instance via the web interface at:

```
https://n8n.yourdomain.com
```

## Authentication

- <strong>Username</strong>: admin (as set in the N8N_BASIC_AUTH_USER environment variable).
- <strong>Password</strong>: adminpassword (as set in the N8N_BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD environment
  variable).

Once logged in, you can begin creating workflows and automating tasks!

## Step 6: Stopping and Restarting n8n

To stop the containers, you can run:

```bash
docker-compose down
```

This will stop the containers and remove them, but the data will still persist thanks to the Docker volume <code>n8n_data</code>.

If you want to restart the containers (after stopping them), use:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

## Step 7: Scaling and Customization

### Scaling n8n

If you want to run multiple instances of n8n for load balancing, you can modify your <code>docker-compose.yml</code> file to scale the n8n service. For example, to scale n8n to 2 instances:

```yaml
n8n:
  image: n8nio/n8n
  container_name: n8n
  deploy:
    replicas: 2
```

### Customizing n8n

You can customize the behavior of your n8n instance in the following ways:

- <strong>Storage</strong>: Modify the database settings to use a different database (e.g., MySQL)
  instead of PostgreSQL.
- <strong>Time Zone</strong>: Change the <code>GENERIC_TIMEZONE</code> environment variable to your
  desired timezone.
- <strong>Add Custom Credentials</strong>: If you're using external APIs, you can add custom
  credentials via the n8n interface.

## Step 8: Updating n8n

To update your n8n installation to the latest version, follow these steps:

1. Pull the latest version of the Docker image:

   ```bash
   docker pull n8nio/n8n:latest
   ```

2. Restart the containers:

   ```bash
   docker-compose down
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

This will restart the services with the new image version.
