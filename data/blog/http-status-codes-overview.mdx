# HTTP Status Codes Overview

HTTP status codes are essential for web communication, helping clients and servers understand request outcomes. They are grouped into five categories, each starting with a digit from 1 to 5, indicating the type of response. Below, I provide a brief overview of each category and highlight a few key codes, with more detailed articles available for all listed codes.

## Informational (1xx)

These codes indicate the server has received the request and is continuing to process it. For example, 100 Continue suggests the client should proceed with sending the request body, often used for large uploads.

## Successful (2xx)

These codes mean the request was successful. A common example is 200 OK, returned when a web page loads correctly, and 201 Created, used when a new resource is made, like creating a user account.

## Redirection (3xx)

These codes indicate the client needs to take additional action, usually following a new URL. For instance, 301 Moved Permanently shows a permanent URL change, like a website moving domains, while 302 Found is for temporary redirects.

## Client Error (4xx)

These codes suggest an error on the client's side. A well-known example is 404 Not Found, seen when a webpage doesn't exist, and 401 Unauthorized, requiring login for access. An unexpected detail is 418 I'm a Teapot, a humorous code for teapots refusing to brew coffee, occasionally used for fun in web apps.

## Server Error (5xx)

These codes indicate server-side issues. For example, 500 Internal Server Error occurs when the server encounters an unexpected problem, like a script error, and 503 Service Unavailable is used during maintenance or overload.

## Introduction to HTTP Status Codes

HTTP status codes are three-digit responses from servers to client requests, categorized into five groups based on the first digit: informational (1xx), successful (2xx), redirection (3xx), client error (4xx), and server error (5xx). These codes facilitate communication, helping diagnose issues and understand server responses. The user requested articles for all listed codes, and this analysis covers each with explanations, examples, and best practices, ensuring accessibility and depth.

## Detailed Articles by Category

### 1xx Informational

- **100 Continue**: Indicates the server received headers and is ready for the body, useful for large uploads. Example: A client uploads a file, sends headers first, gets 100 Continue, then sends data. Best practice: Wait for 100 before sending large bodies to save bandwidth.
- **101 Switching Protocols**: Shows the server is switching protocols, like to WebSockets. Example: Client upgrades to WebSocket, server responds 101, enabling real-time communication. Best practice: Ensure server supports the new protocol.
- **102 Processing**: Indicates ongoing processing, used for long tasks. Example: Complex calculation starts, server sends 102, client waits for final response. Best practice: Use sparingly to avoid overhead.
- **103 Early Hints**: Sends preliminary links for resources, improving load times. Example: Server hints at CSS files during page load, client fetches early. Best practice: Use for critical resources to speed up rendering.

### 2xx Successful

- **200 OK**: Standard success, returns requested data. Example: Browsing a site, getting 200 with the page. Best practice: Ensure response matches expected data.
- **201 Created**: New resource created, like a new account. Example: POST creates user, returns 201 with location. Best practice: Include Location header for new resource.
- **202 Accepted**: Request accepted but not completed, for async tasks. Example: Email sent, server queues, returns 202. Best practice: Provide status check mechanisms.
- **203 Non-Authoritative Information**: Response from cache, not original. Example: Proxy serves cached page, returns 203. Best practice: Verify if freshness is critical.
- **204 No Content**: Success, no body returned, like deletes. Example: DELETE resource, get 204. Best practice: Use for operations without data return.
- **205 Reset Content**: Success, reset document view, like form clears. Example: Form submit, server returns 205, browser clears fields. Best practice: Use for UI resets post-action.
- **206 Partial Content**: Partial resource sent, for range requests. Example: Resume download, get 206 for missing part. Best practice: Support for large files to save bandwidth.
- **207 Multi-Status**: Multiple statuses for batch operations, WebDAV use. Example: PROPFIND on files, some found, some not, returns 207 with XML. Best practice: Format XML per WebDAV specs.
- **208 Already Reported**: Status already in multi-status, WebDAV. Example: Duplicate file reports, server uses 208. Best practice: Optimize responses to avoid redundancy.
- **226 IM Used**: Differential response for updates, delta encoding. Example: Update large file, get 226 with changes. Best practice: Use for large, frequently updated resources.

### 3xx Redirection

- **300 Multiple Choices**: Multiple resource versions, client chooses. Example: Document in languages, server lists, client picks. Best practice: Provide clear choice lists.
- **301 Moved Permanently**: Permanent URL change, update references. Example: Site moves domains, returns 301 to new URL. Best practice: Cache for SEO benefits.
- **302 Found**: Temporary redirect, keep original URL. Example: Maintenance page, returns 302, revert post-maintenance. Best practice: Don't cache as permanent.
- **303 See Other**: Redirect after processing, often post-form. Example: Form submit, redirect to confirmation, 303. Best practice: Use for GET redirects post-action.
- **304 Not Modified**: Resource unchanged, use cache. Example: Refresh page, get 304, use cached copy. Best practice: Use conditional requests to save bandwidth.
- **305 Use Proxy**: Deprecated, resource via proxy, not recommended. Example: Historical, now unused. Best practice: Avoid, use other proxy methods.
- **306 Switch Proxy**: Deprecated, unused, historical proxy switch. Example: No current use, obsolete. Best practice: Do not use in modern apps.
- **307 Temporary Redirect**: Temporary, keep method, like 302 but stricter. Example: Maintenance, 307 to temp page, keep POST. Best practice: Ensure method preservation.
- **308 Permanent Redirect**: Permanent, keep method, like 301 but stricter. Example: Blog moves, 308 to new URL, keep POST. Best practice: Use for permanent changes, method safety.

### 4xx Client Error

- **400 Bad Request**: Invalid request syntax. Example: Missing field in POST, get 400. Best practice: Validate inputs client-side.
- **401 Unauthorized**: Need authentication. Example: Access protected page, get 401, log in. Best practice: Use HTTPS for security.
- **402 Payment Required**: Reserved, not widely used, for future payment systems. Example: Hypothetical pay-per-view, get 402. Best practice: Consider alternatives for now.
- **403 Forbidden**: Access denied, even with auth. Example: No permission for file, get 403. Best practice: Log access attempts for security.
- **404 Not Found**: Resource missing. Example: Wrong URL, get 404. Best practice: Custom 404 pages for user guidance.
- **405 Method Not Allowed**: Method not supported. Example: DELETE on GET-only endpoint, get 405. Best practice: Check allowed methods via OPTIONS.
- **406 Not Acceptable**: No matching response format. Example: JSON request, XML only, get 406. Best practice: Use content negotiation.
