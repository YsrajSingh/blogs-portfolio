Hey, this article is nearly 500 words long, and I hope you'll stay with me until the end.

I'm a software engineer with two and a half years of experience in the tech industry. I work for a well-regarded IT company with a team size of around 60–100 people. The company is among the best in my city, offering a solid salary and a steady stream of projects — something not all companies here can provide. Still, despite the stability, I sometimes wonder if a paycheck alone is enough, especially with a few years of experience under my belt (but we all need that paycheck).

## The Paradox

My daily routine is something like I think many in this field can relate to: wake up, head to the office, work, return home, and do it all again the next day. This cycle had me questioning if I was really growing or just going through the motions. So, I decided to break out of that loop by building a side project — an Instagram content aggregator. The idea was to create a script that pulled content from other accounts and posted it on my own page every hour. I spent two months building and fine-tuning it, and while it technically worked but the reality was different. Despite posting over 225 posts, it only earned 5 new followers in a month. And when I found that large Instagram accounts (have around 1 Million followers) were selling for next to nothing(just 5000 INR), I realized this wasn't the financial solution I'd hoped for.

Before this, I had worked on several individual projects but struggled to complete many of them. The uncertainty of their future value often held me back — would these projects truly benefit me in the long run? The bigger question that lingered in my mind was:

> Am I working on something that will set me apart from the rest of the developers?

This constant doubt made it difficult to stay focused and committed, leaving many of my ideas unfinished.

## The Struggle for Focus

After this, I didn't give up on learning, though. I decided to dive into machine learning and bought a course on Udemy. I was motivated at first, fully engaged and excited to learn. But after a couple of weeks, my enthusiasm fizzled. I struggled to stay focused, which made me question my discipline and dedication to the field.

## Professional Growth

My professional work experience has been broad, covering Python, React, Git, AWS, TypeScript, Laravel, Vue.js, Node.js, Next.js, and various databases like PostgreSQL, MySQL, and MongoDB. However, the rapid pace of project turnover in a service-based company means I've worked on many technologies but rarely mastered any one of them. In fact, there are some technologies I only used for a day or two on smaller tasks. I began to wonder — am I a Python developer? A frontend specialist? Or am I more of a generalist with no clear area of expertise?

Currently, I'm tackling a project that involves integrating OpenAI with real-time protocols (RTP) for audio calls, which has exposed gaps in my knowledge of WebSockets and real-time communication. It's a reminder that, despite my experience, there's always more to learn, and sometimes I still feel unprepared.

## The Future of My Career

Looking ahead, I want to set some goals to bring more clarity and purpose to my career. I'd like to narrow down a core skill set, perhaps specialize in a single tech stack, and make time for deep learning rather than surface-level knowledge. Financial stability is essential, but so is building expertise and growth in a focused area. I'm also open to seeking mentorship, connecting with those who have faced similar challenges, and gaining insights from their experiences.

## Conclusion

In the end, this journey has shown me that while experience is valuable, the quality of that experience — and what we learn from it — matters even more. My goal now is to turn these reflections into action, steadily building my skills, finding fulfillment in my work, and sharing these insights with others who may feel the same. It's an evolving path, but I'm committed to learning, growing, and hopefully inspiring others along the way.

While I may not have all the answers, I'm committed to continuous learning and growth. By setting realistic goals, staying focused, and seeking guidance from experienced mentors, I hope to overcome the challenges of the tech industry and build a successful career.
