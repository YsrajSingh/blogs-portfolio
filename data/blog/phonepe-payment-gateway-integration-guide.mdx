At the start of this year, I learnt how to integrate the PhonePe payment gateway into a website. This guide not only shares that experience but also provides a roadmap for anyone looking to integrate PhonePe into their Android or iOS apps. The process and challenges are similar across all platforms. So, lets dive deep in how to integrate PhonePe Payment Gateway.

## Why businesses choose PhonePe Payment Gateway?

Before diving into the integration, let's address why businesses choose PhonePe over competitors like Stripe or Razorpay. While Stripe and Razorpay are popular, the question is: why PhonePe? The answer is simple — **lower service charges**. Currently, PhonePe does not charge its clients, making it an economical choice. However, this could change at any time in the future. I hope this answers your question.

**Please refer to this article for Payment Gateway Charges. PhonePe is at last**

## A little about PhonePe Admin Panel

On the flip side, the PhonePe admin panel falls short compared to its competitors. You (as a developer) may got frustrated while integrating payment gateway. Because it lacks functionalities like creating test credentials or regenerate API keys directly. Frustration is common, especially during the testing phase and a little on Production.

## Setting Up Your PhonePe Account

To begin, ensure you have an account on [PhonePe Business](https://business.phonepe.com/login) and some programming expertise. Now, let's tackle the first challenge — generating test credentials.

### Test vs. Production Credentials

PhonePe's Developer Settings inside Admin Panel only display production credentials. For test credentials or regenerate Production API keys, you must contact their customer support. Here's how:

1. **Raise a Ticket:** Navigate to the "Help" section in the admin panel. Under the relevant error category, select **Contact Us** to raise a ticket and then describe your concern.
2. **Call Support:** If the ticket system fails, call PhonePe's business support team for assistance.

> **Pro Tip:** Avoid using Google's suggested email ("merchant-pgsupport@phonepe.com"). It's outdated and will redirect you to the ticketing process.

You can't create new production API keys and can't regenerate current one by own from admin panel. For all, you just need to "Contact Support" team.

### Test Credential Components

After contacting support, you'll receive the following test credentials:

- **Merchant ID:** Test IDs usually start with "test".
- **Salt Index:** A unique random number (e.g., 1 for testing).
- **Salt Key:** A key provided by PhonePe (e.g., "b80c575a-a6b6–4c42–8e6b-9b22d35d894c").
- **Environment:** Use `Env.UAT` for testing and `Env.PROD` for production.

## Integration Process

Now that you have the credentials, let's integrate PhonePe using **React** and **Django** as an example. We are not here for show integration at code level. But this can give you an idea, how you can integrate.

[PhonePe Documentation for python integration](https://developer.phonepe.com/v1/reference/python-setup/)

### Backend Integration

1. **Initialize Payment:** Create a backend API to initialize payments. Pass parameters like `merchant_transaction_id`, `amount`, `merchant_user_id`, `callback_url`, and `redirect_url` to PhonePe's SDK.
2. **Generate Payment URL:** Use the `pay_page_pay_request_builder` function to get a payment URL.
3. **Redirect User:** Redirect users to the payment URL, letting PhonePe handle the payment process.

### Verify Payment

After payment:

1. Use the `merchant_transaction_id` to verify the payment via PhonePe's `check_status` function.
2. Handle statuses like `SUCCESS`, `PENDING`, or `FAILED`.

> **Note:** Avoid using local storage or sessions to handle `merchant_transaction_id` for unauthenticated users.

### Supported Payment Methods

PhonePe supports specific methods during testing. Refer to their [UAT testing docs](https://developer.phonepe.com/v1/docs/uat-testing/) for details.

## Common Pitfalls and Solutions

**Domain Mismatch Errors:**

- Ensure the domain used for payment requests matches the one whitelisted during account creation.
- Verify that your callback and redirect URLs share the same domain.

> Example: If PhonePe whitelisted `www.example.com`, ensure all URLs use [www.](http://www..)

**Ticketing Issues:**

- Follow up with customer support if tickets don't open correctly.
