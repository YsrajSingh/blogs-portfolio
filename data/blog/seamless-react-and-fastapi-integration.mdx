In today's dynamic web development landscape, the integration of frontend and backend technologies has become crucial for building powerful, interactive web applications. In this guide, we will walk you through the process of seamlessly integrating React, a leading frontend JavaScript library, with FastAPI, a modern Python web framework, on the same domain. By the end of this tutorial, you will have a web application where React handles the user interface, and FastAPI manages the backend logic — all under a single domain.

## Understanding the Stack

React and FastAPI make a powerful combination for building modern web applications.

## Introduction

In this comprehensive guide, we will walk you through the steps to achieve this integration. Our goal is to set up a website, let's call it www.example.com, where the default route serves a React application to users, but with a twist. When users navigate to www.example.com/docs, they will encounter FastAPI's interactive documentation, and when they visit www.example.com/admin, they will access an admin panel — all within the same web application. Let's start!

## Setting Up a FastAPI Project

Before we dive into the integration process, we need to set up a FastAPI project. Follow these steps:

### Create a Virtual Environment

Begin by creating a new virtual environment. On Linux and Mac, use the following command:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
```

On Windows:

```bash
.venv\Scripts\activate
```

Ensure you have Python and pip installed. You can verify their versions with:

```bash
python --version
pip --version
```

### Manage Dependencies

Create a `requirements.txt` file to manage dependencies. You can do this manually or use:

```bash
pip freeze > requirements.txt
```

Add the following lines to `requirements.txt`:

```plaintext
fastapi
uvicorn[standard]
```

### Install Dependencies

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Create a FastAPI App

Create a `main.py` file with the following code:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI

app = FastAPI()

@app.get("/")
async def root():
    return {"message": "Hello, world!"}
```

### Run the FastAPI App

Start the FastAPI app with the command:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

You can access your FastAPI app at http://127.0.0.1:8000.

## Building a New React App

Now, let's create a new React app and integrate it with FastAPI:

### Create a React App

Use the following command to create a new React app named "Frontend".

```bash
npx create-react-app Frontend
```

### Install Dependencies

Navigate into the "Frontend" folder using `cd Frontend`, then run `yarn` or `npm install` to install the necessary dependencies.

### Build the React App

Build the React app with the command:

```bash
yarn build

# or

npm build
```

This will create a "build" or "dist" folder with the production-ready React app.

### Update FastAPI Code

Modify your `main.py` file to serve the React app build at the root path. Here's the updated code:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from fastapi.middleware.cors import CORSMiddleware
from starlette.responses import FileResponse
from starlette.staticfiles import StaticFiles

app = FastAPI()

# Add CORS middleware
app.add_middleware(
    CORSMiddleware,
    allow_origins="*",
    allow_credentials=True,
    allow_methods=["*"],
    allow_headers=["*"],
)

# Frontend URL
@app.get("/")
def index():
    return FileResponse("frontend/dist/index.html")

@app.exception_handler(404)
async def exception_404_handler(request, exc):
    return FileResponse("frontend/dist/index.html")

app.mount("/", StaticFiles(directory="frontend/dist/"), name="ui")
```

Make sure to adjust the file paths if your React build folder has a different name.

## Conclusion

In this tutorial, we've demonstrated how to seamlessly integrate React and FastAPI on the same domain. With React handling the frontend and FastAPI managing the backend, you now have the foundation to build dynamic and interactive web applications that cater to both user experience and functionality. Whether you're developing locally or for production, this integration offers a powerful solution for modern web development.
