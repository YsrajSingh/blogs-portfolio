# The Hidden Pitfall of Password Encryption in Django: Avoid This Rookie Mistake

Everyone makes mistakes, and as a fellow human, I've had my share. One area where I stumbled recently was with password encryption in Django. If you're working with Django or planning to, I want to share a lesson from my own error so you can avoid the same pitfall.

## The Mistake: An Unfortunate Slip

Here's where things went awry: I made a seemingly minor error with password handling in Django, but it had major implications. I had two panels in my project — a client panel and an admin panel — and everything seemed to be functioning fine. **However, in the admin panel, when inviting a new user, there was a crucial step I missed.**

Here is the code I used while creating a new entry in the `auth_user` table when sending an invite to new users:

```python
from django.contrib.auth.models import User

user = User.objects.create_user(username=username, password=None, email=email)
user.save()
```

This code looks straightforward, but there's a crucial detail missing. I thought setting the password to `None` would be harmless. But here's where the problem started.

## The Right Way: How to Handle Passwords in Django

Django provides a secure way to store passwords using a technique called hashing. Hashing is a one-way function that transforms a plain text password into a seemingly random string of characters. This string, called a hash, cannot be reversed back into the original password.

Here's the proper way to set passwords in Django:

**Create a User Instance:**

```python
user = User(username=username, email=email)
```

**Set the Password:**

```python
user.set_password(password)  # This will hash the password
```

**Save the User:**

```python
user.save()
```

By using `user.set_password(password)`, Django generates a secure hash of the user's password before storing it in the database. This protects your users' information even if your database is compromised.

## The Consequence: What Went Wrong

Now, let's say you have a feature where users can be invited through email. You might be tempted to use something like this:

```python
user = User.objects.create_user(username=username, password=None, email=email)
```

This code seems logical — the user doesn't have a password yet, so you set it to `None`. However, Django doesn't actually store `None` in the password field. Instead, it generates a random string to ensure data integrity.

For example, a hashed password should look something like:

```
pbkdf2_sha256$260000$7a3d92e6f8f623ab$6c4eab74c5f047ef8b3f0d01f6a6d74b4fbd9d6b530bfe6a0a74aaf7fa79024d
```

But in my case, I ended up with random strings like:

```

```

This inconsistency was noticed by my client. Not only did this expose my oversight, but it also made me feel quite embarrassed.

## Conclusion: Lessons Learned and Moving Forward

We all make mistakes, but it's important to learn from them. This error taught me a valuable lesson about handling passwords in Django properly. Always use Django's methods to set and hash passwords to ensure they are secure and managed correctly.

If you're new to Django or working on similar projects, take this as a reminder to double-check your implementation. Mistakes like these can be avoided with careful attention and understanding.

Remember, even experienced developers make mistakes. What matters is how we learn from them and strive to improve.
