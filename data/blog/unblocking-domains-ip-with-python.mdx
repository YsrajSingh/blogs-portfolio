Welcome to our step-by-step guide on domain unblocking using a Python script. In this article, we'll explore the process of unblocking domains that were previously blocked, all without the need for third-party libraries. All you need is a basic understanding of Python and the root permissions for your system. Root permissions are essential for this process, and on Linux and macOS, you can use 'sudo,' while on Windows, administrative access to the terminal is required.

## The Python Script

In the following sections, we'll dive into the Python script responsible for unblocking domains. This script is as straightforward and efficient as its blocking counterpart and requires no external libraries. It empowers you to regain access to previously blocked domains.

```python
import platform

# Define the domain or IP address you want to unblock
target = "www.google.com"  # Customize this to your desired domain or IP

# Determine the path to the host file based on the operating system
system = platform.system()
if system == "Windows":
    hosts_path = r"C:\Windows\System32\drivers\etc\hosts"
else:
    hosts_path = "/etc/hosts"

# Read the content of the host file
with open(hosts_path, "r") as hosts_file:
    lines = hosts_file.readlines()

# Create a new host file content without the blocking entry
new_lines = [line for line in lines if not line.strip().endswith(target)]

# Write the new content back to the host file
with open(hosts_path, "w") as hosts_file:
    hosts_file.writelines(new_lines)

print(f"Unblocked {target} in the host file.")
```

As demonstrated in the code above, you can specify the domain you want to unblock by customizing the 'target' variable. The script efficiently removes the block entry, allowing access to your desired domain once again.

## Customization

Customization is at your fingertips. If you wish to unblock a different IP or domain, simply modify the 'target' variable. This flexibility empowers you to tailor the script according to your specific needs.

## Verification

To verify whether the domain is successfully unblocked, you can use two verification methods outlined in the previous sections.

1. **Browser Verification:** Enter the domain in your browser's search bar and hit Enter. If the loads, your domain unblock is working successfully.
2. **Terminal Ping Test:** Open your terminal and enter `ping www.google.com` (replace with your domain). If it shows the IP address this indicates that our domain is unblocked.
