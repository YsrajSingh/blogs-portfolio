# What I Wish I Knew as a Fresher Developer

Hey, I'm Yashraj, and I've been on quite a journey as a software developer for the past 2.5 years. It hasn't been a smooth ride, and trust me, I've learned more from my mistakes than from my successes. But I wouldn't change a thing because every step has shaped me into who I am today.

Before diving into my advice, let me take you through a quick story about where I started, what I struggled with, and why I'm finally confident enough to share my experiences with you.

I completed my Master's in Computer Applications from Lovely Professional University, and in August 2024, I am in the world of software development since June 2022. I had dreams, aspirations, and all the enthusiasm in the world. The initial months felt like a breeze: 10 AM to 7 PM office hours, a nice salary, the joy of calling myself a developer… it was all so exciting!

But soon, I found myself hitting a wall. Everything was going great on the surface, but deep down, I felt restless. I felt like there was so much more to learn. So much I was missing out on. And that's when the real journey began.

## The "Fresher" Phase: The Illusion of Having It All Together

When you're fresh out of college, there's this misconception that you're supposed to know everything. But guess what? Nobody does. I started out thinking I could just figure it all out as I went along. But there was one catch: **I was constantly chasing after "the next big thing."**

At the start, I dived into multiple projects, helping friends with their assignments, trying to learn every framework that popped up in my feed, and attempting to keep up with the latest trends. I thought, _"If I learn a little bit about everything, I'll be ahead of the curve. This will make me a well-rounded developer."_

But soon, reality hit.

_Learning is great only if we start creating something._

## The Dangers of "Tutorial Hell": Chasing Everything, Mastering Nothing

I fell into what I now call **tutorial hell**.

I started watching tutorials obsessively — Django, Flask, ReactJS, TypeScript, Docker, you name it. Every time a new tutorial or blog post came up, I would drop everything and dive into it. I thought, _"This might be the game-changer! This could be the next skill that sets me apart!"_

But here's the truth I discovered the hard way: you can't become an expert in everything, especially when you're juggling a full-time job. The more I learned, the less I actually _mastered_. Instead of deepening my skills, I was just scratching the surface of everything — and I wasn't really good at anything.

The problem was, I wasn't applying what I was learning. I'd watch a tutorial on Django, then switch to FastAPI, and a week later, I'd find myself trying to learn VueJS. The cycle never ended. I'd start a project, but never finish it. And I kept thinking to myself, _"What am I doing with my time?"_

I was lost in the noise, overwhelmed, and burnt out. If you're reading this and feeling like you're stuck in a similar cycle, I get it. It's tough. You're trying to stay ahead, trying to learn everything that could be useful, and yet you're spinning in circles.

_Sometimes you'll go in circles, other times it'll feel like you're in decline, then somehow you'll start heading in the right direction (at least it seems that way)._

## The Realization: Specialization Over Diversification

Then came the turning point. One evening, I was looking at my GitHub profile, filled with half-finished projects and a scattered mix of technologies. It hit me: I had 2.5 years of experience, but I wasn't an expert in anything. **How was I going to answer in an interview when they asked, "What are you really good at?"** I could talk about all these languages and frameworks, but when it came down to it, I wasn't confident that I was truly an expert in any one of them.

That realization was humbling. It forced me to step back and reevaluate my entire approach to learning and career development.

## Narrowing Down: The Power of Focus

Here's the part where I finally _get it_.

Instead of trying to learn everything, I needed to focus. I needed to **pick a few core technologies** and truly specialize in them. And that's exactly what I did.

I decided to focus on **Python**.

- **Python** because I've always had a passion for backend development, and I knew I wanted to dive deeper into fields like **Machine Learning** and **Data Science** in the future.

This is the technologies I'm focusing on now. Will I learn other things later? Of course. But I'm going to master these first. And that's been a game-changer.

## The Truth About Growth: It's About Consistency, Not Perfection

I'm not saying that you should only learn one thing and stick to it forever. The key is to build **depth before breadth**. When you focus on a few technologies and master them, you can start to build deep, meaningful projects. You'll have something to show for your efforts. And that's when you start gaining real confidence.

I'll be honest: I wasted a lot of time in the first year of my career, bouncing from one tutorial to the next, trying to keep up with every new framework and language that came out. But now, I know that it's okay to let go of that constant chase. It's okay to slow down, take a breath, and focus.

The process of learning and growing is _messy_. There will be moments when you feel like you're not good enough, or when you look at other people's success stories and think, _"Why am I not there yet?"_ But here's what I've learned: **Everyone has their own pace.**

Focus on **consistent growth**, not perfection. Focus on improvement, not comparison.

## My Advice to Freshers: Don't Let The Noise Distract You

To anyone starting out in this field, here's the advice I wish someone had given me:

1. **Pick a technology, stick to it, and go deep**. It doesn't matter if everyone else is learning a new framework or tool. Stick to what aligns with your career goals and interests. Master it.

2. **Projects are your best teacher**. Tutorials are helpful, but building real-world projects is where the magic happens. Apply what you learn, create something meaningful, and put it out there.

3. **Don't jump between technologies too soon**. I know it's tempting. Every time something new pops up, it feels like you need to learn it. But resist the urge. Don't get distracted by every shiny object. Focus on your core technologies, and once you're confident, explore new things.

4. **Find a community**. Surround yourself with people who are on the same path. Whether it's through coding groups, online forums, or social media, having a support system can help you stay motivated and accountable.

5. **It's okay to take a break**. Burnout is real. If you're feeling overwhelmed, step away from the screen, breathe, and give yourself the space to recharge. You don't need to learn 10 things at once to be successful.

## The Future: Keep Evolving

I'm still learning. I'm still growing. And I'm still figuring things out. But now, I'm doing it with focus, purpose, and clarity. I'm not chasing every new framework that comes along. Instead, I'm focusing on **becoming an expert in a few areas** and creating projects that challenge me.

If you're a fresher, or even if you've been in the industry for a while but feel stuck, remember: your journey is unique. It's okay to go through ups and downs. What matters is that you learn from every experience, you focus on what truly matters, and you keep evolving. **Stay disciplined, be patient, and trust the process**.

Remember, success doesn't come from knowing everything; it comes from mastering what truly matters to you and the field you're passionate about.

## Conclusion

You've got this.

The road won't always be easy, but as long as you stay true to your goals and keep learning with intention, there's nothing stopping you from becoming the expert you aspire to be. Stay focused, stay curious, and most importantly, enjoy the ride.
