## Introduction

In this article, we'll explore a Python script that allows you to prank your friends by sending OTPs from Zomato to their mobile numbers. However, it's essential to emphasize that the primary intent of this script is educational, and any misuse or harm is strongly discouraged.

## Prerequisite

Before we dive into the script, make sure you have Python and pip installed on your system, along with a basic understanding of Python programming.

You won't need any third-party dependencies for this project. All you need is your setup and the provided script.

## Getting Started

1. Create a folder named "Script" in your preferred location.
2. Inside the "Script" folder, create three files:

   - main.py
   - data.json
   - requirements.txt

3. In the "requirements.txt" file, add the following line:

```typescript
requests
```

4. In the "data.json" file, paste the following code:

```json
[
  {
    "name": "ZOMATO",
    "url": "https://accounts.zomato.com/login/phone",
    "headers": {},
    "body": {
      "country_id": 1,
      "type": "initiate",
      "csrf_token": "aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa",
      "lc": "bbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbbb",
      "verification_type": "sms",
      "number": ""
    }
  }
]
```

**Note**: You can update the "country_id" to match your country's ID.

5. In the "main.py" file, paste the Python script provided:

```python
import requests
import json


def send_requests(data, mobile_number):
    for obj in data:
        name = obj["name"]
        url = obj["url"]
        headers = obj["headers"]
        payload = obj["body"]

        # Update payload with the mobile number
        for key in payload.keys():
            if key in keys_to_update:
                payload[key] = mobile_number

        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=payload)

        # Check the response status code
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print(f"{name}: OTP sent successfully")
        else:
            print(f"{name}: Request failed with status code {response.status_code}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Fetch mobile number from the user
    mobile_number = input("Please Enter Phone Number: ")

    # Opening JSON file
    with open("data.json") as f:
        data = json.load(f)

    # Keys to update in Payload
    keys_to_update = ["number"]

    # Send requests
    send_requests(data, mobile_number)
```

## Running the Script

Now, follow these commands to execute the script:

```python
# Create a virtual environment
python3 -m venv .venv

# Activate the virtual environment (Linux/Mac)
source .venv/bin/activate

# Activate the virtual environment (Windows)
.venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip3 install -r requirements.txt

# Run the Python script
python3 main.py
```

After executing the script, you will be prompted to enter the target phone number. Press enter, and within 5 seconds, you will receive a Zomato OTP.

## Important Note

Please be aware that you can only use this script five times a day. After reaching the limit, you'll need to wait 24 hours before running it again. Also, ensure that you only use this script on phone numbers with the owner's consent.

## Understanding the Script

Before we dive into the code, let's understand what this script does and how it works.

## The Code

```python
import requests
import json


def send_requests(data, mobile_number):
    for obj in data:
        name = obj["name"]
        url = obj["url"]
        headers = obj["headers"]
        payload = obj["body"]

        # Update payload with the mobile number
        for key in payload.keys():
            if key in keys_to_update:
                payload[key] = mobile_number

        response = requests.post(url, headers=headers, data=payload)

        # Check the response status code
        if response.status_code == 200:
            print(f"{name}: OTP sent successfully")
        else:
            print(f"{name}: Request failed with status code {response.status_code}")


if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Fetch mobile number from the user
    mobile_number = input("Please Enter Phone Number: ")

    # Opening JSON file
    with open("data.json") as f:
        data = json.load(f)

    # Keys to update in Payload
    keys_to_update = ["number"]

    # Send requests
    send_requests(data, mobile_number)
```

## Conclusion

This Python script is intended for educational purposes and serves as a fun way to learn about programming. Always use your coding skills responsibly and ethically. Enjoy your Zomato OTP prank responsibly and consider the privacy and consent of others.
